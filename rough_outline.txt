-UX:              Signed in -     Quiz open and close messages for email, make sure you specify which channel and team name they quiz is open/closed for. Team/Channel should be in the subject line (just the first 10 chars)
-email            Signed in -     Change the link when it is sent in an email. Why is the link this crazy text
-email            Signed in -     Fix the name in the email winner. It currently says firstName_lastName it should be firstName lastName (no underscore)
-Database         Signed in -     Why is there a temp account edit redis variable created and not deleted in redis when user edits account.
-Subscription:    Signed in -     Add a note to the bottom of subscription page saying "Once the monthly subscription is paid you will have access to the dashboard"
-Best Practice:   Signed in -     Put a ';' at the end of every SQL query you have for Triviafy

- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- Make the internal logged in pages all the same style (including the 3 steps when creating account). Make it smaller purple banner, with team name / channel name / user name at the top.
-Fix the schedueled task that stores in aws s3

-Change email new user to talk about how it is a passion project, any feedback.?
********- When a user creates a question successfully, they get redirected From:[] -> To:[https://triviafy.com/create/question/user/form/submit/success] page, but the problem is that this page pulls all images. Which will get very expensive in the long run to pull thousands of images from AWS. This page needs to be brokwn doen to 10 images per page. For now just change the redirect to avoid hitting this page altogether.
**** Change the way the weekly quiz made printing works. It should have a counter and arr to know how many companies quizzes were made for at the end.
* If user makes account on Saturday, after quiz is already closed and announced, the additoinal late team user should not receive email about quiz open and close for the week. Too many emails at once.
* Add user's display name to the top under company channel so on Inspeclet you can see who is doing what.
* remove duplicate redis logged in users
- Add the quiz categories selection for new users to select the categories they want
- Add sample quiz to the logged in page navbar > quiz > first item on dropdown.
-^ also add quiz categories under quiz settings

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
-pages that have question on them (this should be templated better across pages)
  -Not logged in:
    -All example quiz pages
  -Logged in:
    -Sample quiz
      -Sample Quiz results page
    -Dashboard main page
    -Quiz Archive specific version pages
    -Create question, all questions confirmed page
-----------------------------------------------------------------------







Making changes like the user_nested_dict categories_selected thing. It was added! but people who are signed in already with redis, they will get an error if they try to hit a page that uses that logic. Solution: You need to build a try: except: clause so that it tries for that value and if logged in user redis does not have it, then a function recreated the latest redis columns/values dict and stores it back in redis based on user-uuid.


For printing quick tests

localhost_print_function('- - - - - - - 0 - - - - - - -')
localhost_print_function('i')
localhost_print_function(i)
localhost_print_function(type(i))
localhost_print_function('- - - - - - - 0 - - - - - - -')
